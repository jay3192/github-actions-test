# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          
      # Setup Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3.6.0
        with:
          # Version Spec of the version to use. Examples: 12.x, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0.
          node-version: 18
          # Used to pull node distributions from node-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
          #token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
          # Used to specify a package manager for caching in the default directory. Supported values: npm, yarn, pnpm.
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
